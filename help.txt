This is the program where you get to visualize abstract syntax trees in exchange for entering the concrete syntax into the textbox, and pressing the Draw Tree button.
Our program currently supports the LET language from the book, as well as the Proc language from EOPL. For example, try entering the following into the textbox, without quotes: let x = 5 in -(x,3)"]))
If you entered it correctly, you will see a tree! Congratulations! You have successfully run the program.
Notice that in addition to the tree, there is also black text that shows the result of evaluation of your entered program
Now that you know how to run the program, try a few harder examples. Here are a few to choose from
let f = proc(x) +(x,5) in (f 6)
(proc(x) +(x,5) 10)
Best of luck to you, and thank you for using our program!
